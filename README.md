## Purpose\Overview: 
Convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, based on analysis of NYC Bike-Sharing Data.

## Resources:

## Summary:
NYC Bike sharing is most frequently used by males on a long term subscription basis instead of single-use. 

Highest day and time usage is Pre-Work commute time (7am-9am) and Post-Work commute time (3pm-7pm). 

Saturday has highest overall usage time between 9am-8PM.

Suggestions for implementing the same system in Des Moins,check for hit tourist zones, and business-centric areas for highest bike rental usage opportunities.
