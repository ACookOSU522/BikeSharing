# BikeSharing
## Purpose\Overview: 
Convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, based on analysis of NYC Bike-Sharing Data.

## Resources:
Jupyter/Pandas, Tableau Public for Desktop, Excel

## Results:

Used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. 

Using the converted datatype, created a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary:
NYC Bike sharing is most frequently used by males on a long term subscription basis instead of single-use. 

Highest day and time usage is Pre-Work commute time (7am-9am) and Post-Work commute time (3pm-7pm). 

Saturday has highest overall usage time between 9am-8PM.

Suggestions for implementing the same system in Des Moins,
